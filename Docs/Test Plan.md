# Test Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the testing strategy for the **AI for Daily Life â€” Unified Focus Assistant**. It covers the different levels of testing, the tools and techniques that will be used, and the criteria for a successful test.

## 2. Levels of Testing

### 2.1. Unit Testing

*   **Objective**: To test individual components and functions in isolation.
*   **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library.
*   **Scope**: All utility functions, UI components, and backend modules.

### 2.2. Integration Testing

*   **Objective**: To test the interactions between different components and services.
*   **Tools**: Jest, Supertest.
*   **Scope**: API endpoints, database interactions, and integrations with external services (Gmail, Slack, Google Calendar, Calendly, Notion, Linear, Trello, OpenAI).

### 2.3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

*   **Objective**: To test the complete application flow from the user's perspective.
*   **Tools**: Cypress.
*   **Scope**: User authentication, data ingestion, feed display, one-click actions, task creation across platforms, AI cost monitoring, and digest generation.

### 2.4. AI Cost Monitoring Testing

*   **Objective**: To verify accurate tracking and optimization of AI token usage and costs.
*   **Tools**: Jest, custom cost tracking utilities.
*   **Scope**: Token usage tracking, cost calculations, budget alerts, optimization recommendations.

## 3. Mocked Provider APIs

To ensure reliable and repeatable tests, we will use mocked versions of the external provider APIs (Gmail, Slack, Google Calendar, Calendly, Notion, Linear, Trello). This will allow us to simulate different scenarios and edge cases without relying on the actual services.

## 4. Red-Team Prompts for LLM Safety

We will conduct red-teaming exercises to test the safety and robustness of the LLM-powered features. This will involve crafting adversarial prompts to try and elicit biased, inappropriate, or harmful responses from the AI models.

## 5. Load and Latency Tests for Digest Generation

We will use a load testing tool like k6 to simulate a large number of users generating digests simultaneously. This will help us to identify any performance bottlenecks and ensure that the digest generation process can scale to meet demand.
