*   **Webhooks**: Vercel Serverless Functions

## 4. Data and Event Flow

1.  **Ingestion**: Data from Gmail, Slack, and Google Calendar is ingested into the system via Vercel Cron Jobs and webhooks.
2.  **Storage**: The ingested data is stored in the Supabase Postgres database.
3.  **Processing**: The backend processes the data, using the OpenAI API for summarization, action extraction, and priority scoring.
4.  **Presentation**: The processed data is presented to the user in the frontend, in a prioritized feed.
5.  **Actions**: Users can perform one-click actions on the feed items, which trigger backend processes to interact with the respective APIs (Gmail, Slack, Google Calendar).

## 5. Digest Sequencing

1.  **Trigger**: A Vercel Cron Job triggers the digest generation process at 8am, 1pm, and 5pm daily.
2.  **Data Retrieval**: The backend retrieves the latest high-priority items from the database.
3.  **Summarization**: The OpenAI API is used to generate a summary of the items.
4.  **Formatting**: The summary is formatted into an email or Slack message.
5.  **Delivery**: The digest is sent to the user via their preferred channel (email or Slack)._
