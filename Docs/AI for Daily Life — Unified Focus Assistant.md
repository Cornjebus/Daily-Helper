- **3× Daily Digest Push**: Automated summaries delivered via email/Slack DM at 8am, 1pm, and 5pm
- **Advanced Task Management**: One-click task creation in Notion, Linear, and Trello with external linking
- **AI Cost Monitoring**: Real-time token usage tracking, cost optimization, and budget alerts
- **Enhanced Email Processing**: Enron dataset-trained models for superior email summarization
- **Meeting Integration**: Calendly integration for automated scheduling and meeting context

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.5.3 + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Node.js 22.x on Vercel Serverless Functions
- **Database**: Supabase (Auth, Postgres, Storage)
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI API with cost monitoring and fine-tuned models
- **Integrations**: Gmail, Slack, Google Calendar, Calendly, Notion, Linear, Trello
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Software Development Lifecycle Coverage

This documentation package addresses the first four critical phases of the software development lifecycle:

1. **Planning** ✅ - Goals, scope, objectives, resources, timelines, and risks defined in PRD and BRD
2. **Requirements Analysis** ✅ - Detailed functional and non-functional requirements in FRS and SRS
3. **Design** ✅ - Architecture, UI/UX, database design, and technical specifications completed
4. **Implementation Readiness** ✅ - Technical design, deployment guides, and configuration templates provided

## Getting Started

1. Review the **PRD** and **BRD** to understand the business context and goals
2. Study the **SRS** and **FRS** for detailed functional requirements
3. Examine the **System Architecture** and **TDD** for technical implementation guidance
4. Follow the **Deployment and Ops Guide** for setup instructions
5. Use the **Test Plan** to ensure quality assurance
6. Reference the **UI/UX Design Document** for interface implementation

## Next Steps

With this comprehensive documentation package, the development team can proceed to the implementation phase with clear guidance on:

- Technical architecture and design patterns
- Database schema and API endpoints
- UI/UX specifications and component requirements
- Deployment and operational procedures
- Testing strategies and quality assurance
