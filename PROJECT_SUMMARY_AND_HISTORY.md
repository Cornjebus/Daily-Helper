# Junie Project - Complete Development History & Current State

## Project Overview
**Project Name**: Junie (Daily Helper)
**Purpose**: AI-powered daily assistant that organizes emails and messages in a unified dashboard
**Current Status**: Running on main branch with core Gmail/Calendar features
**Tech Stack**: Next.js 15.5.4, TypeScript, Supabase, OpenAI API, Tailwind CSS

---

## What We Built Successfully ✅

### 1. Core Application Infrastructure
- **Next.js 15.5.4 Application** with Turbopack
- **Supabase Backend** for authentication and data storage
- **Responsive Dashboard** at `/dashboard`
- **Authentication System** with session management
- **Environment Configuration** with proper secret management

### 2. Gmail Integration (WORKING)
- **OAuth 2.0 Authentication** with Google
- **Email Fetching** from Gmail API
- **Email Sync Functionality** - fetches emails from today
- **Thread Management** - groups emails by conversation
- **Database Storage** - emails stored in `email_threads` and `email_messages` tables
- **Priority Categorization** - sorts emails into Now/Next/Later based on importance

### 3. Google Calendar Integration (WORKING)
- **OAuth Sharing** with Gmail (same Google auth)
- **Event Fetching** from Calendar API
- **Event Sync** to `feed_items` table
- **Priority Assignment** based on event timing

### 4. AI Processing System (PHASE 3 - WORKING)
- **OpenAI Integration** using GPT-4o-mini model
- **Email Processing Pipeline**:
  - Fetches recent emails
  - Analyzes with AI for urgency/importance
  - Categorizes into Now/Next/Later
  - Calculates priority scores (1-10)
  - Generates action items
- **Cost Tracking** - tracks OpenAI API usage and costs
- **AI Cost Dashboard** component for monitoring expenses
- **Database Schema** includes:
  - `ai_processing_results` table
  - `ai_daily_summaries` table
  - Cost tracking fields

### 5. Daily Digest System
- **Email Digest Feature** using Resend API
- **Scheduled Cron Jobs** (8am, 1pm, 5pm)
- **Digest Generation** from feed items
- **Email Templates** for formatted digests

### 6. Database Schema
Successfully created migrations for:
- User authentication (`auth.users`)
- User integrations (`user_integrations`)
- Feed items (`feed_items`)
- Email threads and messages
- AI processing results
- Daily summaries

### 7. UI Components
- **Dashboard** with integration cards
- **Email Item Component** for displaying messages
- **Digest View Component** for daily summary
- **AI Cost Dashboard** for tracking expenses
- **Settings Page** skeleton

### 8. Testing Infrastructure
- **Jest Configuration** set up and working
- **Test Suite** for API routes
- **Integration Tests** for email processing

## What We Attempted But Removed ❌

### 1. Slack Integration (EXTENSIVE ATTEMPT - REMOVED)
**Branch**: `slack` (still exists but not merged)

#### What Was Built:
- **OAuth Flow Implementation** (`/app/api/auth/slack/`)
- **Event Webhook Handler** (`/app/api/slack/events/`)
- **Message Sync Endpoint** (`/app/api/slack/sync/`)
- **Slack Bolt App** (`/lib/slack/bolt-app.ts`)
- **Socket Mode Configuration** for development
- **Database Schema** for Slack messages
- **Test Suite** for Slack integration
- **UI Integration** in dashboard

#### Why It Failed:
- **Invalid client_id Error** - OAuth wouldn't authenticate
- **Events API Issues** - URL verification challenges
- **Complex Configuration** - Required ngrok, multiple tokens, app review
- **Manifest Parsing Errors** when creating new app

#### What We Learned:
- Slack requires HTTPS for OAuth (can't use localhost)
- Socket Mode eliminates webhook needs but still requires OAuth
- Slack app creation via manifest had YAML parsing issues
- Multiple token types needed (Bot, App-Level, OAuth)

### 2. WhatsApp Integration (STARTED - REMOVED)
- Created setup documentation (`WHATSAPP_SETUP.md`)
- Researched WhatsApp Business Cloud API
- Decided against implementation due to complexity
- Removed all WhatsApp-related files

2. **Gmail Connection** and email sync
3. **Calendar Connection** and event sync
4. **AI Email Processing** with categorization
5. **Dashboard View** with Now/Next/Later tabs
6. **Cost Tracking** for AI usage
7. **Daily Digest Emails** (if configured)

### Environment Variables Required
```env
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY

# Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI

# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY
OPENAI_ACTIVE_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

# Email (Optional)
RESEND_API_KEY
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL

# App Config
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
NEXTAUTH_URL
NEXTAUTH_SECRET
```

### Deployment Status
- **Vercel Deployment**: Successfully deployed
- **Production URL**: Available (configured in Vercel)
- **CORS Configuration**: Set up for Supabase

---

## Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture Choices
1. **Next.js App Router** (not Pages Router)
2. **Supabase** for backend (not Firebase/custom)
3. **Server Components** where possible
4. **Client-side State** minimal, mostly server-driven

### Integration Patterns
1. **OAuth 2.0** for all external services
2. **Webhook Handlers** as API routes
3. **Database-First** approach for data storage
4. **Queue-like Processing** for AI tasks

### Security Measures
1. **Environment Variables** for all secrets
2. **Row-Level Security** in Supabase
3. **API Route Protection** with auth checks
4. **Token Encryption** for OAuth tokens

---

## Problems Encountered & Solutions

### 1. OpenAI API Issues
**Problem**: GPT-5 model didn't exist, breaking AI processing
**Solution**: Switched to gpt-4o-mini with fallback to gpt-3.5-turbo

### 2. Database Schema Mismatches
**Problem**: Missing columns causing insert failures
**Solution**: Created proper migrations with all required fields

### 3. Vercel Build Failures
**Problem**: Environment variables required at build time
**Solution**: Added dummy variables to build script

### 4. Supabase CORS Errors
**Problem**: "Failed to fetch" in production
**Solution**: Updated Supabase dashboard with production URLs

### 5. Jest Configuration
**Problem**: moduleNameMapping typo
**Solution**: Fixed to moduleNameMapper
